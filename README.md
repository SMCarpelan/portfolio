#### Technical Skills: Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Azure, MATLAB

### Education
**Master of Science in Technology, Tampere University (_Ongoing_)**         
I am currently pursuing a second master’s degree in my spare time. My major is Industrial Engineering and Management, with a special focus on the IT industry and data-intensive businesses. My goal is to gain a more holistic view of how value is created within these fields and to better understand the managerial aspects associated with them. The studies encompass a range of courses covering cost accounting, business management, technology management, strategic planning, as well as advanced data analysis (incl. pattern recognition/machine learning) and software engineering as tools to support value creation. 

**Master of Science in Economics, Tampere University (_2021_)**          
I switched my major to pure economics and also included its undergraduate studies in my degree, as well as a healthy amount of courses in math and statistics.     

**Master of Science in Economics, Turku School of Economics (_2017_)**                    
The core studies of the degree program included everything from the foundations of marketing to the nuances of modern financial administration. I majored in business law and taxation, and in my bachelor’s thesis I researched the way an open public procurement procedure is conducted in a situation where the national public procurement law is overshadowed by the union level directive.

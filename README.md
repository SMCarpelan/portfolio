### Education
**Master of Science in Technology, Tampere University (_Ongoing_)**         
I am currently studying to become an academic engineer. My major is Industrial Engineering and Management, with a special focus on the IT industry and data-intensive businesses. My goals are to gain a more holistic view of how value is created within these fields, better understand the managerial aspects of the processes involved, and enhance my technical skills related to Data Science. The curriculum includes a range of courses covering cost accounting, business management, technology management, strategic planning, as well as advanced data analysis (including pattern recognition and machine learning) and software engineering as tools to support value creation.

**Master of Science in Economics, Tampere University (_2021_)**          

I switched my major to pure economics and also included its undergraduate studies in the degree, as well as a healthy amount of courses in math and statistics. For my thesis, I conducted an extensive quantitative research project within the field of regional and urban economics. The focus of my study was to explore the relationship between the prices of condominiums and their distance from city centers. To accurately account for spatial dependencies, I utilized spatial autoregressive models, specifically the SAR and SAR-SAR models. This rigorous approach allowed me to address spatial autocorrelation effectively, enhancing the reliability of my findings.
The completion of my degree, coupled with the specialized knowledge gained through my thesis, qualified me to work as an economist.

**Master of Science in Economics, Turku School of Economics (_2017_)**                    
The core studies of the degree program included everything from the foundations of marketing to the nuances of modern financial administration. I majored in business law and taxation, and in my bachelor’s thesis I researched the way an open public procurement procedure is conducted in a situation where the national public procurement law is overshadowed by the union level directive.

# Business-oriented Data Professional

#### Technical Skills: Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Azure, STATA, PowerBI, MATLAB

### 1 - Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Finnish Tax Administration (_June 2023 – Present_)**                       
My day-to-day work consists of deriving insights from vast amounts of data by utilizing programming skills, conducting statistical analysis, and leveraging analytics tools provided by Microsoft Azure. My primary focus is on measuring the impact of specific actions by managing big data against a pre-planned experimental design. This approach involves applying my expertise in programming (SQL, R and Python) and statistics to ensure accurate and effective impact assessment. Additionally, my role involves the detailed reporting of research findings to stakeholders, ensuring that the insights and implications are clearly communicated for informed decision-making.
          
**Data Engineering Analyst @ Accenture (_February 2022 – June 2023_)**       
I was one of ten people selected from over 600 applicants across four Nordic countries to participate in a three-month-long Data Engineer program organized by AW Academy and Accenture. The course covered SQL, data integration, ETL, Python, Power BI, machine learning, Azure, AWS, and GCP. Graduating resulted in a permanent employment contract as a Data Engineer at Academic Work and a position as a Data Engineering Analyst at Accenture. After one year, I decided to seek a role that would allow me to better utilize my quantitative background in economics, focusing primarily on data analysis.

### 2 - Education
**Master of Science in Technology, Tampere University (_Ongoing_)**         
I am currently studying to become an academic engineer. My major is Industrial Engineering and Management, with a special focus on the IT industry and data-intensive businesses. My goals are to gain a more holistic view of how value is created within these fields, better understand the managerial aspects of the processes involved, and enhance my technical skills related to Data Science. The curriculum includes a range of courses covering cost accounting, business management, technology management, strategic planning, as well as advanced data analysis (including pattern recognition and machine learning) and software engineering as tools to support value creation.

**Master of Science in Economics, Tampere University (_2021_)**          
I switched my major to pure economics and also included its undergraduate studies in the degree, as well as a healthy amount of courses in math and statistics. For my thesis, I conducted an extensive quantitative research project within the field of regional and urban economics. The focus of my study was to explore the relationship between the prices of apartments and their distance from the city center. To accurately account for spatial dependencies, I utilized spatial autoregressive models, specifically the SAR and SAR-SAR models. This rigorous approach allowed me to address spatial autocorrelation effectively, enhancing the reliability of my findings.
The completion of my degree, coupled with the specialized knowledge gained through my thesis, qualified me to work as an economist.

**Bachelor of Science in Economics, Turku School of Economics (_2017_)**                    
The core studies of the degree program included everything from the foundations of marketing to the nuances of modern financial administration. I majored in business law and taxation, and in my bachelor’s thesis I researched the way an open public procurement procedure is conducted in a situation where the national public procurement law is overshadowed by the union level directive.

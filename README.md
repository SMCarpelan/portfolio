### Education
##### MSc Technology  ||  Tampere University (_Ongoing_)         
– I am currently pursuing my second master’s degree in my spare time. My major is Industrial Engineering and Management, with a special focus on the IT industry and data-intensive businesses. My goal is to gain a more holistic view of how value is created within these fields and to better understand the managerial aspects associated with them.                              
– The studies encompass a range of courses covering cost accounting, business management, technology management, strategic planning, as well as advanced data analysis (incl. pattern recognition/machine learning) and software engineering as tools to support value creation.                          
##### MSc Economics || Tampere University (_2021_)          
– A            
– B               
##### BSc Economics || Turku School of Economics (_2017_)  
– During my years in Turku School of Economics I gained a firm grasp on all things relating to the art of business. The core studies of the degree program included everything from the foundations of marketing to the nuances of modern financial administration.                      
– I majored in business law and taxation, and in my bachelor’s thesis I researched the way an open public procurement procedure is conducted in a situation where the national public procurement law is overshadowed by the union level directive. It was deemed to be very good.
